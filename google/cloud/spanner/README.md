# Google Cloud Spanner C++ Client Library

<!-- This file is automatically generated by ci/generate-markdown/generate-spanner-readme.sh -->

This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for interacting with
[Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/), which is a fully
managed, scalable, relational database service for regional and global
application data.

Please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Supported Platforms

* Windows, macOS, Linux
* C++11 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC \>= 4.9, Clang >= 3.8, and MSVC \>= 2019)
* Environments with or without exceptions
* Bazel and CMake builds

## Documentation

* Official documentation about the [Cloud Spanner][cloud-spanner-docs] service
* [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this client library
* Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/) directory contains a minimal environment to help
you quickly get started using this client library. The following is the "Hello
World" program you'll be running, which should give you a taste of this
library.

```cc
#include "google/cloud/spanner/client.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) try {
  if (argc != 4) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0]
              << " project-id instance-id database-id\n";
    return 1;
  }

  namespace spanner = ::google::cloud::spanner;
  spanner::Client client(
      spanner::MakeConnection(spanner::Database(argv[1], argv[2], argv[3])));

  auto rows =
      client.ExecuteQuery(spanner::SqlStatement("SELECT 'Hello World'"));

  for (auto const& row : spanner::StreamOf<std::tuple<std::string>>(rows)) {
    if (!row) throw std::runtime_error(row.status().message());
    std::cout << std::get<0>(*row) << "\n";
  }

  return 0;
} catch (std::exception const& ex) {
  std::cerr << "Standard exception raised: " << ex.what() << "\n";
  return 1;
}
