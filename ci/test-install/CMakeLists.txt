# A minimal CMakeList.txt to *test* the install Cloud Spanner C++ client.
#
# This is not intended to be a demonstration of how to write good CMakeList.txt
# files, nor is it a general solution to create CMake files for google-cloud-
# cpp-spanner. It is simply a minimal CMake file to verify that (a) the
# installed libraries contain all required headers, and (b) the installed CMake
# configuration files are usable.
