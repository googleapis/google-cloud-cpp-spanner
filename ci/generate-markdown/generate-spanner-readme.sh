cat <<'_EOF_'
This directory contains an idiomatic C++ client library for interacting with
[Google Cloud Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/), which is a fully
managed, scalable, relational database service for regional and global
application data.

Please note that the Google Cloud C++ client libraries do **not** follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Supported Platforms

* Windows, macOS, Linux
* C++11 (and higher) compilers (we test with GCC \>= 4.9, Clang >= 3.8, and MSVC \>= 2019)
* Environments with or without exceptions
* Bazel and CMake builds

## Documentation

* Official documentation about the [Cloud Spanner][cloud-spanner-docs] service
* [Reference doxygen documentation][doxygen-link] for each release of this client library
* Detailed header comments in our [public `.h`][source-link] files

## Quickstart

The [quickstart/](quickstart/) directory contains a minimal environment to help
you quickly get started using this client library. The following is the "Hello
World" program you'll be running, which should give you a taste of this
library.

```cc

# Dumps the contents of quickstart.cc starting at the first #include, so we
# skip the license header comment.
