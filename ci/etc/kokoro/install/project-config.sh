# We need a recent version of the Google Cloud Platform proto C++ libraries:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_CPP_CMAKEFILES_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### googletest

# We need a recent version of GoogleTest to compile the unit and integration
# tests.

# ```bash
@INSTALL_GOOGLETEST_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

# #### google-cloud-cpp-common

# The project also depends on google-cloud-cpp-common, the libraries shared by
# all the Google Cloud C++ client libraries:

# ```bash
@INSTALL_GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_COMMON_FROM_SOURCE@
# ```

FROM devtools AS install

# #### Compile and install the main project

# We can now compile, test, and install `@GOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_REPOSITORY@`.

# ```bash

RUN cmake -H. -Bcmake-out
RUN cmake --build cmake-out -- -j "${NCPU:-4}"
