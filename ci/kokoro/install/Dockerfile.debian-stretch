## [START INSTALL.md]

# First install the development tools and libcurl.
# On Debian 9, libcurl links against openssl-1.0.2, and one must link
# against the same version or risk an inconsistent configuration of the library.
# This is especially important for multi-threaded applications, as openssl-1.0.2
# requires explicitly setting locking callbacks. Therefore, to use libcurl one
# must link against openssl-1.0.2. To do so, we need to install libssl1.0-dev.
# Note that this removes libssl-dev if you have it installed already, and would
# prevent you from compiling against openssl-1.1.0.

# ```bash
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y build-essential cmake git gcc g++ cmake \
        libc-ares-dev libc-ares2 libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl1.0-dev make \
        pkg-config tar wget zlib1g-dev
# ```

# #### Protobuf

# We need to install a version of Protobuf, recent enough that it supports the
# Google Cloud Platform proto files:

# ```bash
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build
RUN wget -q https://github.com/google/protobuf/archive/v3.9.1.tar.gz
RUN tar -xf v3.9.1.tar.gz
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build/protobuf-3.9.1/cmake
RUN cmake \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes \
        -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
        -H. -Bcmake-out
RUN cmake --build cmake-out --target install -- -j ${NCPU:-4}
RUN ldconfig
# ```

# #### gRPC

# To install gRPC we first need to configure pkg-config to find the version of
# Protobuf we just installed in `/usr/local`:

# ```bash
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build
RUN wget -q https://github.com/grpc/grpc/archive/v1.23.1.tar.gz
RUN tar -xf v1.23.1.tar.gz
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build/grpc-1.23.1
RUN make -j ${NCPU:-4}
RUN make install
RUN ldconfig
# ```

# #### googleapis

# We need a recent version of the Google Cloud Platform proto C++ libraries:

# ```bash
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build
RUN wget -q https://github.com/googleapis/cpp-cmakefiles/archive/v0.1.5.tar.gz
RUN tar -xf v0.1.5.tar.gz
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build/cpp-cmakefiles-0.1.5
RUN cmake \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=YES \
    -H. -Bcmake-out
RUN cmake --build cmake-out --target install -- -j ${NCPU:-4}
RUN ldconfig
# ```

# #### googletest

# We need a recent version of GoogleTest to compile the unit and integration
# tests.

# ```bash
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build
RUN wget -q https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.10.0.tar.gz
RUN tar -xf release-1.10.0.tar.gz
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build/googletest-release-1.10.0
RUN cmake \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes \
      -H. -Bcmake-out
RUN cmake --build cmake-out --target install -- -j ${NCPU:-4}
RUN ldconfig
# ```

# #### google-cloud-cpp-common

# The project also depends on google-cloud-cpp-common, the libraries shared by
# all the Google Cloud C++ client libraries:

# ```bash
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build
RUN wget -q https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp-common/archive/v0.13.0.tar.gz
RUN tar -xf v0.13.0.tar.gz
WORKDIR /var/tmp/build/google-cloud-cpp-common-0.13.0
RUN cmake -H. -Bcmake-out \
    -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
    -DGOOGLE_CLOUD_CPP_TESTING_UTIL_ENABLE_INSTALL=ON
RUN cmake --build cmake-out --target install -- -j ${NCPU:-4}
RUN ldconfig
# ```

FROM devtools AS install

# #### Compile and install the main project

# We can now compile, test, and install `google-cloud-cpp-spanner`.

# ```bash
WORKDIR /home/build/project
COPY . /home/build/project
RUN cmake -H. -B/o
RUN cmake --build /o -- -j "${NCPU:-4}"
WORKDIR /o
RUN ctest -LE integration-tests --output-on-failure
WORKDIR /home/build/project
RUN cmake --build /o --target install
# ```
