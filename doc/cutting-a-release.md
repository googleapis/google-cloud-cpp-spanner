# Creating a new release of google-cloud-cpp-spanner

Unless there are no changes, we create releases for `google-cloud-cpp-spanner`
every month, or if there is a major announcement or change to the status of the
library.

The intended audience of this document are developers in the
`google-cloud-cpp-spanner` project that need to create a new release. The
audience is expected to be familiar with the project itself, [git][git-docs],
[GitHub][github-guides], and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## Preparing for a release

First you should collect and update the release notes for the project. Prepare
a pull request (PR) with the necessary changes to the README files in each
project.

Assuming you are working on your own fork of the `google-cloud-cpp-spanner`
project, and `upstream` points to the `googleapis/google-cloud-cpp-spanner`
remote, these commands should be useful in identifying important changes:

```bash
# Summarize the output of this into google/cloud/spanner/README.md
git log upstream/master
```

It is not recommended that you create the release branch before this PR is
ready, but in some circumstances it might be needed, for example, if a large
change that could destabilize the release is about to be merged, or if we want
to create the release at an specific point in the revision history.

## Create the release branch

To find the next release number, look at the existing branch names on the
`upstream` repo and select the next available "v.0.N" version number.

```bash
git remote show upstream
```

Throughout this document we will use this variable to represent the release
name:

```bash
# Use the actual release prefix (e.g. v0.5) not just `N`.
export RELEASE="v0.N"
```


If you decide to cut&paste the commands below, make sure that variable has the
actual release value, e.g. `v0.5` or `v0.7`, and not the generic `N`.

Clone the main repository to create the tags and branch:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:googleapis/google-cloud-cpp-spanner.git releases
cd releases
```

Create a tag for the new release.

```bash
git tag "${RELEASE}.0"
git push origin "${RELEASE}.0"
```

Create a new branch based on that tag and push the branch to the upstream repository:

```bash
git checkout -b "${RELEASE}.x" "${RELEASE}.0"
git push --set-upstream origin "${RELEASE}.x"
```

This will start a CI build cycle. The builds *should* pass, as we normally keep
`master` in a releasable state.

**NOTE:** No code review or Pull Request is needed as part of this step.

## Create pre-release for review.

Create a pre-release using
[GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp-spanner/releases/new).
Use the tag that you just created ("${RELEASE}.0").
Make sure to check the `pre-release` checkbox.

Copy the relevant release notes into the description of the release.

After you create the release, capture the SHA256 checksums of the
tarball and zip files, and edit the notes to include them. These
commands might be handy:

```bash
TAG="${RELEASE}.0" # change this to the actual tag
wget -q -O - "https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp-spanner/archive/${TAG}.tar.gz" | sha256sum
wget -q -O - "https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-cpp-spanner/archive/${TAG}.zip" | sha256sum
```

You can publish this release once the notes are updated.

### Ask your colleagues to review the release notes.

Edit the notes as needed.

### Publish the release

Uncheck the pre-release checkbox and publish.

## Generate and upload the documentation to googleapis.dev

Manually run a Kokoro job
`cloud-devrel/client-libraries/cpp/google-cloud-cpp-spanner/publish-refdocs` in
the Cloud C++ internal testing dashboard and specify the branch name
(e.g. `v0.2.x`) in the `Committish` field. This job will generate and upload
the doxygen documentation to the staging bucket for googleapis.dev hosting. The
uploaded documentation will generally be live in an hour at the following URLs:
`https://googleapis.dev/cpp/google-cloud-spanner/latest/`.

## Bump the version numbers in `master`

Working in your fork of `gooogle-cloud-cpp-spanner`: bump the version numbers
to the *next* version (i.e., one version past the release you just did above),
and send the PR for review against `master`.

## Review the branch protections

We use the [GitHub Branch Settings][github-branch-settings] to protect the
release branches against accidental mistakes. From time to time changes in the
release branch naming conventions may require you to change these settings.
Please note that we use more strict settings for release branches than for
`master`, in particular:

* We require at least one review, but stale reviews are dismissed.
* The `Require status checks to pass before merging` option is set.
  This prevents merges into the release branches that break the build.
  * The `Require branches to be up to date before merging` sub-option
    is set. This prevents two merges that do not conflict, but nevertheless
    break if both are pushed, to actually merge.
  * The `Kokoro Ubuntu`, `Kokoro Windows`, `cla/google`, and
    `continuous-integration/travis-ci` checks are required to pass.

* The `Include administrators` checkbox is turned on, we want to stop ourselves
  from making mistakes.

* Turn on the `Restrict who can push to matching branches`. Only Google team
  members should be pushing to release branches.
