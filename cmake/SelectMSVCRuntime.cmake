# When compiling against *-static vcpkg packages we need to use the static C++
# runtime with MSVC. The default is to use the dynamic runtime, which does not
# work in this case.  This seems to be the recommended way to change the
# runtime:

# Note that currently we use VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET to determine if the static
# runtime is needed. In the future we may need to use a more complex expression
# to determine this, but this is a good start.
